# Doubly Linked Lists"

## ðŸ“š General

This project is focused on understanding and working with **doubly linked lists** in C.

### What is a doubly linked list?

A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains:
- A data field
- A pointer to the **next** node
- A pointer to the **previous** node

This allows traversal of the list in **both directions**, which is more flexible than singly linked lists.

### How to use doubly linked lists

To use a doubly linked list:
- Create a struct with `prev`, `next`, and data fields.
- Dynamically allocate memory for each new node using `malloc`.
- Carefully update the `next` and `prev` pointers when inserting or removing nodes.

### Learning to learn

As part of this project, we are encouraged to find and understand 
information from reliable sources on our own, instead 
of relying on direct help.
