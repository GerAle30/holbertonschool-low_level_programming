.B Singly Linked list Project

Description
this project focuses on the implementation and usage of singly linked lists in C.
by the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of when and why
to use linked lists insted of arrays, as well as how to efficiently build
and manipulate linked lists.

Learning Objectives

At the completion of this project, you should be able to:

Explain the advantages and disadvantages of linked lists compared to
arrays

implement and manipulate singly linked lists in C

Requirements

.B General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.

All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc

All filees should end with a new line.

A README.md file at the root of the project directory is mandatory.

Code should follow the betty coding style and will be checked using

No global variables allowed

No more than five functions per file.

Only the following C standard library functions are allowed: mallo, freee, and exit.

Use of printf, puts, calloc, realloc, and other standard I/O functions is forbidden.

Your are allowed to use _putchar

You don't need to push _putchar.c(our file will be used).

Example main.c files are provided for testing but should not be pushed to the repository.

All function prototypes should be declared in the header file lists.h

All header files should be properly inlcude-guarded.

Files & Functions

Lists.h- Header file containing structure definition and function
prototypes

Print_list.c- Function to print all elements of a linked list.

Additional functions for linked list manipulaiton will be implemented
as part of the project.

Compilation & Testing

To compile and test your code, use the following command:
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-print_list.c -o a


Run the executable

./executable_name
