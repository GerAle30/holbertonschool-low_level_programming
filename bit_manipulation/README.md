# Bit Manipulation

## Description

This project explores the concept of bit manipulation in C. 
It includes functions that use bitwise operators to perform tasks 
efficiently and at a low level.

---

## Learning Objectives

- How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators
- Understand binary representation and bit masks
- Practice using `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`

---

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compilation will be done on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using:
  ```bash
  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

-No global
-Max 5 functions per file
-Only allowed funcitons: malloc,free,exit
-betty style and documentation required
-All header files must be include guarded

/*file          Description*/
main.h          Header file with all protoypes
0-get_bit.c     Retrieves value of a bit at index
1-set_bit.c     Sets a bit to 1 at a given index
2-clear_bit.c   Sets a bit to 0 at index
3-toggle_bit.c  toggles a bit (bonus maybe?)
